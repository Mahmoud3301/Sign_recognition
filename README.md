**Sign_Recognition** is an interactive system for recognizing hand signs using **computer vision** and **deep learning**.  
It is designed for learning gesture recognition, building AI-based accessibility tools, and experimenting with real-time image processing.

💡 Recognize hand gestures in real-time, classify them accurately, and expand for multiple applications like sign language interpretation or game controls.
